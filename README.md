## Description
Quick demo of Jupyter notebook as a means of accessing and visualizing Cryptocurrency prices with the coinbase api.

## Usage
Clone this into its own directory, and access using a Jupyter notebook instance.  
To launch a notebook instance, all you need to do is type
```
jupyter notebook
```
... the above command will open a Jupyter notebook instance and open up the current directory in your broswer once Jupyter itself has been installed (see below).

## Mac installation of Jupyter
In case someone is using a mac, they will need to set up a computing environment, which can be accomplished by installing 

1. mac homebrew
2. installing (using homebrew)
3. jupyter (using pip)

Mac homebrew install should ask you to download the latest version of Xcode development tools, which will take a while.
Finally, you will want to install the python packages for coinbase and plotly. This is done with pip. It's really easy, and the easiest way is just to google "install plotly with pip". 


A guide on getting homebrew set up is here:  
https://howchoo.com/python/install-pip-python


Key commands are:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install python
```

Which, I think, can just be executed from the terminal.
